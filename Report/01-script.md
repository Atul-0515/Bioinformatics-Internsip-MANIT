# 16S rRNA Analysis Setup Script - Project Analysis

## 1. Script Purpose
**Main Objective:** This script sets up the computational environment for analyzing 16S rRNA sequencing data to compare gut microbiota across four study groups: normal individuals, obesity patients, diabetic patients, and patients with both T2D and obesity. It installs all necessary bioinformatics tools and creates a standardized analysis pipeline.

## 2. Key Functions
The script performs essential setup tasks for microbiome analysis:

**Bioinformatics Tool Installation:**
- **Quality Control:** FastQC, FastP, MultiQC for assessing sequencing data quality
- **Taxonomic Classification:** Kraken2, Bracken, MetaPhlAn for identifying bacterial species
- **Sequence Processing:** SeqTK, BBMap for data cleaning and filtering
- **Statistical Analysis:** R packages (phyloseq, vegan, DESeq2) for microbiome statistics
- **Machine Learning:** Python libraries (scikit-learn, XGBoost) for predictive modeling
- **Data Visualization:** ggplot2, matplotlib, seaborn for creating figures

**Project Organization:**
- Creates structured directories for organizing different analysis outputs
- Sets up logging system for tracking analysis steps

## 3. Input/Output
**Input Requirements:**
- Conda package manager installation
- Internet connection for downloading bioinformatics software

**Output Generated:**
- Complete analysis environment named `microbiome_analysis`
